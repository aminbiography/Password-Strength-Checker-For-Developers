<h1>Password Strength Checker</h1>
This Python function check_password_strength() verifies the strength of a given password based on several criteria. The function checks if the password meets the following conditions:

Length: The password must be at least 8 characters long.
Uppercase Letters: The password should contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
Lowercase Letters: The password should contain at least one lowercase letter (a-z).
Digits: The password should include at least one numeric digit (0-9).
Special Characters: The password should include at least one special character from the set !@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>.
If the password meets all these criteria, it is considered strong. Otherwise, the function will provide specific feedback on what is missing.

<h1>How It Works:</h1>
The function first checks the password's length and alerts if it's less than 8 characters.
Then, it uses regular expressions (re.search()) to check for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
The function returns a message indicating whether the password is strong or what needs improvement.
Example Usage:
python
Copy code
password = input("Enter a password to check: ")
print(check_password_strength(password))
Example Output:
If the password is strong: "Password is strong!"
If it's missing any criteria: Specific feedback like "Password should include at least one uppercase letter."
This script can be used for ensuring that user passwords meet basic security standards.
